            Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( born 7 July 1981) is an Indian former
            professional cricketer who was captain of the Indian national
            cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test
            cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is a right-handed wicket-keeper
            batsman. He led the team to three ICC trophies including the 2007
            ICC World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC
            Champions Trophy. Under his captaincy, India won the ACC Asia Cup
            two times, in 2010 and 2016. India also won ICC Test Championship
            Mace two times in 2010, 2011 and ICC ODI Shield for one time in 2013
            under his leadership. He is considered as one of the greatest
            Captains and Wicket Keeper-Batsmen of all time. Throughout his 15
            year long international career, Dhoni has won several awards and
            accolades. Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against
            Bangladesh in Chittagong, and played his first Test a year later
            against Sri Lanka. He played his first T20I also a year later
            against South Africa. In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy
            from Rahul Dravid and he also selected as T20I captain of India in
            this year. In 2008, he was selected as Test Captain. His
            captaincy record in this format was mixed, successfully leading
            India to a series win against New Zealand in 2008 and the
            Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against
            Australia while losing to Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South
            Africa by big margins in away conditions.

            announced as captain of the Chennai Super Kings IPL franchise, for
            the 2022 IPL season, succeeding MS Dhoni.He however stepped down in

            Ambati Thirupathi Rayudu (born 23 September 1985) is an Indian
            professional cricketer and current captain of the Andhra team in the
            Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy championship. He plays as a right-handed
            middle-order batsman, who occasionally keeps wicket and bowls
            right-arm off breaks. He plays for Hyderabad in domestic cricket,
            and Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Rayudu

            the India Under-19 team at the 2004 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup
            and was expected to break into the senior team. Disputes with
            players and state association, followed by signing up with the
            "rebel" Indian Cricket League, led to him being ignored for national
            team selection. He returned to domestic cricket in 2009 by accepting
            BCCI's amnesty offer and terminating his ICL contract. After strong
            performances for Baroda in domestic cricket and Mumbai Indians in
            the IPL, he was named in the Indian squad for the first time in
            2012. He eventually made his international debut in July 2013, in an
            ODI against Zimbabwe. On 2 July 2019, he announced his retirement
            from all forms of cricket. However, on 29 August 2019, Rayudu said
            that he was willing to play all formats of cricket again.
